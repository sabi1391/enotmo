part:2

mkdir --> to create directory
mkdir -v directoryname ---> v=verbs, create directory and show msg as created
mkdri -p directoryname/directoryname/ --> p=parent, create sub directories under directory
mkdir -m 700 directoryname --> m stads for mode, its will grant permission to directory


ls --> list of files/directories
ls /tmp/directry/ 
ls -ls --> to sort files by size
ls  -l --> list out files with permissions size time and date
ls -ltr --> (l=long list, t=accesstime, r=reverseorder)
ls -la --> display hidden files

part:3

rm -rf -->removefiles or directories
rmdir directoryname--> remove empty directoriesonly
find . -type f -empty --> to find epty file in current directory
find / -type d -empty --> to find empty directory in roo folder

chmod 777 filename
chmod -r 777 directory_name


part4:  

----Displaying command------

cat
cat -n filename
head
head -10 filename
tail
tail -5 filename
tail -f log.log
sed -n 12p filename
--> this will dispaly in between range as between 12 line to 14 line
sed -n "12,14p" filename
sed "s/red/blue/g filename
--> this -i will chages in file output also
ex: 
sed -i "s/hi/hello/g" practice

--System Resourses commands-----

--> this below 3 commends will give which user is loogedin and what doing and average load of cpu
who 
users
w
uname : linux
To know distribution of which linux:
cd /etc
there will release folder
cat /etc/*release
-->How to know which distributaion  of OS u are using?
Each distribution having some specific files names in etc folder, it contains all details of distribution.


uptime : server/system running time

We are using a branchng startagy in our version control system , In my current org we are using git lab and bit bucket, We have a master branch where we have stored alll related code .
Master branch access  only having a lead/architech , once we pushed code to master branch the pipeline will be execute in bitbucket to check the code quality and code coverage. onceget succeful we have implemented sonar qube for quality test of our code itf it will get failure return to develpoer if its success will the code will push to the dev/qa environment.
 Qa team will start the testing once testing is fine we have report called as preprod env where we can call as mirror of the prod environment.
Once we get the sign of from the customer support team and respective stack holders will push the code to the prod environment.


In our environment we have 3 branching startagy like dev where we used to do R&D purpuse , QA where we can push all our user stories, Bug fixes, minor upgartion etc and we have a preprod environmentwhere we can test all the new release and user stories before deploying to the prod.

Agile methodology:
The Agile methodology is a project management approach that involves breaking the project into phases and emphasizes continuous collaboration and improvement. 
 
there are the five type of stages
ideation
development 
testing
development
